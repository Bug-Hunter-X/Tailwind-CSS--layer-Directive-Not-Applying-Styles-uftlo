The problem likely stems from incorrect Tailwind configuration or order of layers.  Here's a corrected example, ensuring that the `components` layer is included in the `content` array within your `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`.

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    // ...other content paths
    { raw: '@layer components' }
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Also ensure that your layer declaration is correctly placed and the classes are being correctly referenced in your HTML or JSX.  If using a CSS preprocessor, verify that it correctly handles Tailwind's directives.
