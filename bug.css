The issue lies in the Tailwind CSS configuration.  I'm using the `@layer` directive to customize some styles, but these custom styles aren't being applied. Here's a simplified example:

```javascript
@layer components {
  .my-custom-class {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
  }
}
```

The `.my-custom-class` styles aren't applied in the browser, even though the `@apply` directive should be injecting the base Tailwind classes.
